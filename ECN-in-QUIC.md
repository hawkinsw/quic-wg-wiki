# Introduction
ECN is short for Explicit Congestion Notification. 
ECN support in transport protocols is a fundamental feature that
should be included in the QUIC specification as a mandatory element.
ECN has the key benefit that it allows for non-destructive congestion
notification by network node, i.e packets are marked instead
discarded.  This is particularly beneficial for realtime applications
with requirements on latency, ECN also has the benefit that it
provides with a congestion signal that is unambiguous.  The benefits
with ECN is described in more detail in [RFC8087](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8087).
The ECN support should be implemented to support both present and
future ECN, the latter is outlined in
[ECN experiments](https://tools.ietf.org/wg/tsvwg/draft-ietf-tsvwg-ecn-experimentation/), of particular interest is the
ability to discriminate between classic ECN and L4S ECN by means of
differentiation between the use of the ECT(0) and ECT(1) code points.
[ECN draft](https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-johansson-quic-ecn-03.txt) also covers this work, there may however be occasions where the wike and the draft are not in synch, the ultimate goal is to move the specific wireformat and how-toÂ´s to the QUIC transport draft later on.

# Design team
A design team will focus of the wireline format of ECN capability exchange as well as the ECN feedback. It is suggested that the design team meet at IETF-100 to discuss the way forward and formalize a first joint version of the ECN specifics for QUIC. 

# Requirements
* R.1 The ECN specification SHOULD be easy to implement. Care should be taken to minimize additional complexity in the implementation of ACK frames and the QUIC congestion control/recovery
* R.2 The ECN feedback MUST report all ECN-CE marked packets. This is important especially for the implementation of L4S support. It is an open question whether detailed packet information is needed or if is sufficient with a report of accumulated number of bytes that are ECN-CE marked.
* R.3 The ECN feedback SHOULD report ECT(0) and ECT(1) marked packets. This is beneficial for the detection of remarking or ECN black holes. 
* R.4 It SHOULD be possible measure amount of Not-ECT marked packets. This MAY be implemented as a dedicated feedback but can also be inferred from the regular ACK frames and the reports of ECN, ECT(0) and ECT(1).
* R.5 A QUIC implementation MUST be able to verify ECN support in the OS network stack. 
* R.6 Initial ECN capability exchange SHOULD verify that ECN works e2e, this SHOULD be further verified at runtime 
* R.7 Initial ECN capability exchange MUST verify that endpoints support ECN, the ECN capability exchange MAY take place either at QUIC connection setup or after the connection setup is completed   

# ECN capability exchange
The ECN capability exchange serves to:
1. Verify that the OS stacks in both endpoints support read and write of the ECN bits in the IP header. This is simple and straightforward in Linux OS stacks. The level of support in Windows and OSX, iOS and Android is less clear.
2. Initially test that ECN works e2e 
## Proposed wire format
The wire format below is proposed for the ECN capability exchange. The capability exchange should take place after the connection setup. It may however take place already at the connection setup.

      0                   1
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |  Type         |C|R|W|U U U|E E|
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

The first byte contains a frame type, registered with IANA (?)
The second byte contains the flags:
* C: Challenge bit, indicates that the transmitted ECN negotiation frame is a challenge, if bit is not set then it is a response.
* R: Possible to read ECN bits in IP header
* W: Possible to write ECN bits in IP header
* EE : Echo of ECN bits
* U: Unused

The ECN negotiation has two steps:
* Challenge/response
* Determine degree of ECN support
## Capability exchange, challenge/response
A peer transmits the ECN negotiation frame with the R,W and EE bits
in the 2nd byte set to '0' and the C bit set to '1'.  This frame is
echoed back with the flags set according to the degree of ECN support
and with the ECN bits in the IP header of the received ECN
negotiation frame copied to the EE field, the C bit is '0'.  As both
peers MUST transmit an ECN negotiation frame there will be a total of
4 ECN negotiation frames transmitted, two challenges and two
responses.

An ECN negotiation frame should be transmitted in a unique packet,
this to avoid that possible loss of ECN negotiation packets cause
loss of other frames than the ECN negotiation frame.

The IP header for the ECN negotiation frame should set the ECN bits
to either ECT(0) or ECT(1), depending on which codepoint is to be used thorughout the connection. The specification of the ECT(0) and ECT(1) is as per the guidelines in [ECN experiments](https://tools.ietf.org/wg/tsvwg/draft-ietf-tsvwg-ecn-experimentation/)
When the corresponding response is received then an EE
pattern of '11' indicates that ECN is likely supported in the
network.  This does not give a full guarantee that ECN is supported
in the network.  Monitoring of the ECN field in the ACK-frame serves
to give further indication of ECN support once ECN is turned on.
An ECN negotiation is declared successful when an ECN negotiation
response is received that indicates ECN support.  A peer is not
allowed to set ECT on outgoing data packets until a successful ECN
negotiation is done.  In other words it is only the ECN negotiation
frame that is allowed to set the ECN bits in the IP header until ECN
negotiation is concluded and successful.

A lack of an ECN negotiation response may indicate that the ECN
challenge frame or the ECN response frame was lost or that a node in
the network deliberately discards ECN-CE marked packets.  The peer
should transmit an additional ECN challenge within an RTO interval in
case a negotiation response is not received, a maximum of ?
retransmissions are attempted.

A failed challenge/response phase indicates that ECN should not be
used in the connection.  [NOTE, a special case is where one peer does
not receive an ECN negotiation response but still receives ECT and CE
marked packets from the other peer.  It is T.B.D how this should be
handled]

## Capability exchange, determine degree of ECN support
If the ECN challenge/response is successful, the degree of ECN
capability depends on how the R, W and EE bits are set.
* R='1' and EE= '11': It is possible to set the ECN bits in outgoing
      packets.
* R='0' or EE <> '11': ECN support is not certain as it is either
      not possible for remote peer to read the ECN bits or that the ECN
      bits are altered.
* W='1' : It is meaningful to send ECN feedback
* W='0' : It is not meaningful to send ECN feedback as the remote
      peer cannot set (write) the ECN bits in the IP header.

The mode mechanism in [RFC6679] can serve as in input to a solution
for the support of ECN in the case that OS ECN support is asymmetric.
It is however unclear how a QUIC implementation can determine
asymmetric ECN support in the underlying OS.  For instance the method
to send ECN marked packets to the local host to determine OS support
does not reveal if the OS ECN support is asymmetric.

# ECN feedback
The ECN feedback echoes the ECN marks back to the sender. The current assumption is that the ECN feedback should be in the same frame as the ACK. The main reason behind this is that it simplifies further processing in the congestion control and error recovery.

At the QUIC interrim (October 2017) it was decided that timestamps should be removed from the default ACK frames, this means that ECN frames are unlikely to be in the default ACK frames as well. Therefore a dedicated ECN+ACK frame is needed.
While timestamps and ECN may not be tightly coupled, there is a possibility that the two can be combined for enhanced congestion control purposes. Two examples are 
1. [SCReAM](https://tools.ietf.org/wg/rmcat/draft-ietf-rmcat-scream-cc/) seamlessly combines ECN/loss feedback and delay estimation, thus delay estimation serves as a fallback for the case that congested nodes are non ECN capable.
2. BBR type bandwidth estimation may be combined with L4S marking for improved MIMD type congestion control, suitable for e.g high bitrate interactive applications such as VR.

This leads to a few questions when a combined ECN+ACK frame is devised.
1. Should it be an ECN+ACK frame only ?
2. Should it be an ECN+ACK+TS frame ?
 
## ECN feedback, wire format
The proposed alternative proposes a format for the ECN-ACK frame. 
It uses one byte to indicate how many bits that
encode each of the ECT/CE fields. The proposed format is useful both for classic ECN and L4S. 

      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |              First Ack Block Length (8/16/32/48)            ...
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |  [Gap 1 (8)]  |       [Ack Block 1 Length (8/16/32/48)]     ...
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |  [Gap 2 (8)]  |       [Ack Block 2 Length (8/16/32/48)]     ...
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                                  ...
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |  [Gap N (8)]  |       [Ack Block N Length (8/16/32/48)]     ...
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |R|R|E1 |E2 |CE | # ECT(0) bytes (0/16/32/48)                 ...
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |  # ECT(1) bytes (0/16/32/48)                                ...
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |  # ECN-CE bytes (0/16/32/48)                                ...
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

The E1,E2 and CE fields indicate the length of each encoding for the
number of ECT(0), ECT(1) and ECN-CE marked bytes.  This is encoded
as:
* 00: 0 bits
* 01: 16 bits
* 10: 32 bits
* 11: 48 bits

R indicates reserved bits.

The proposed encoding enables flexible encoding of the ECN
information, with a minimal 1 octet overhead for the cases where ECN
is not supported by the connection.

# ECN support in various OS stacks
The network stack support for ECN varies between operating systems. In principle, what is needed is the ability to set and read the ECN bits in the IP header, from user space, in other words this access should preferably be possible without root privilege. 
## Linux 
ECN support is straightforward. 
On the sender side the code snippet below sets the ECN capability 

    int iptos = ect; 
    res = setsockopt(fd_out_rtp, IPPROTO_IP, IP_TOS,  &iptos, sizeof(iptos));

ect is 1 for ECT(0) and 2 for ECT(1)

On the receiver side it is necessary to use the recvmsg call with an extended struct to get access to the ECN bits. An example code snippet is found at [ECN in Linux](https://gist.github.com/jirihnidek/95c369996a81be1b854e).
