The key rotation operates with a call to HKDF, using the label "traffic upd". The transform depends on the negotiated cipher suite, and specifically on the hash function specified in that suite.

Here are 2 sets of test vectors used by Picoquic. 

## Suite aes256 gcm sha384

Initial secret:
```
static const uint8_t key_rotation_test_init_sha384[] = {
    1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16,

Rotated secret:
