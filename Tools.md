**This is a listing of tools for analysing, debugging and visualising QUIC (and potentially the HTTP mapping). See also the [Implementations listing](Implementations).**

* [Wireshark](https://wireshark.org/) has a GQUIC decoder<sup>1</sup> and IETF-QUIC decoder (draft08 to draft09). HTTP analysis is possible via integration with the [HTTP/2 decoder](https://wiki.wireshark.org/HTTP2).
Since v2.5.2rc0-68-geea63ae2a7, handshake and payload decryption (-09) is fully functional (only 0-RTT is missing). The TLS (Early) Exporter secret is required which must be provided via a TLS key log file. See for example https://github.com/ngtcp2/ngtcp2/pull/67

* [QUIC-Tracker](https://quic-tracker.info.ucl.ac.be/) is a test suite for IETF-QUIC. It exchanges packets with IETF-QUIC implementations to verify whether an implementation conforms with the IETF specification. The test suite is consisting of several test scenarii. Each of them aims at testing a particular feature of the QUIC protocol. The test suite runs daily, and its results are available on its website.

<sup>1</sup> Wireshark is not capable of decrypting GQUIC packets itself, even if [NSS Keylogging](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/NSS/Key_Log_Format) has been configured. However, if a decrypted trace is supplied to Wireshark it will correctly dissect GQUIC if the "Force decrypt" option is enabled in the Settings. For IETF-QUIC, It is expected that the move to TLS1.3 will allow decryption.
